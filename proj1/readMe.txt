This program is used to find the maximum and minimum values in an array
using two different methods. The first method is a brute force method,
which runs through the entire list linearly, finding the largest and the
smallest values. The other is a divide and conquer algorithm, which, in
this case, is quick sort. This program can be run from the command line.
When run, it will prompt the user with the different options to run. The
user will have to type in one of the following commands for what they
want to see, being either a brute force time execution, divide and
conquer time execution, or a comparision of each of the priors' execution
times. These are chosen by the user typing in b, bf, or brute force for
the brute force method, d, dc, or divide and conquer for the divide and
conquer algorithm, or c, cmp, or compare for the compare function. After
typing in one of these options, the user must type in the size of the
array they wish to compare, between small (100,000), medium (500,000),
and large (1,000,000). These are chosen by the user typing in either s, sm,
or small for small, m, med, or medium for medium, and l, lg, or large for
large. The array is a composed of randomly generated numbers between 1 and
999,999,999. When running either the brute force or the divide and conquer
methods, the minimum and maximum values will be printed out, followed by
the total time taken to run the method. The comparison function will only
print out which method is faster, followed by how much faster it is than
the other. When the program successfully runs once, it will ask for an
input on whether the user would like to exit the program or not. If the
user would like to exit the program, they must type in y or yes to exit.
If they would like to continue, they should type in n or no to continue.
If an invalid input is inserted in any input, then the program will
notify the user the input is invalid and will rerun the previous option.
The user has the option to exit the program at any point by typing either
q, quit, e, or exit.
